# Where is our stuff? Inventory management with Blockchain

# Context
This project proposes a blockchain-based inventory management system that can monitor the transfer, deployment and maintenance of devices without relying on trust through the inherent security, transparency and immutability properties that the blockchain provides. 

In particular, the IoT inventory management system aims to track and trace the relationship between IoT devices, experimental kits that they form, the experiments that they conduct, and the experiment results generated from those kits. The hardware inventories and the researchers conducting experiments can come from different organisations. The blockchain-based inventory management system provides a decentralised and trustworthy platform for coordinating and tracking the information among these entities. 

A prototype was developed based on the Ethereum blockchain and a service-based architecture. The prototype was demonstrated using the inventory management workflow of the ad-hoc IoT testbed instances at the University of Adelaide.
